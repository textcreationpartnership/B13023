            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Our Princely consideration, that by reason of the late vnseasonable weather, the hopefulnesse of the next ensuing Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest is very much indangered, by which, and by the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations, the Stores of Corne for the Prouision of this Kingdome will be much shortened, and the prices in all probabilitie may be much enhaunced.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as Wee are enformed that the scarcitie of Corne and Graine in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Kingdomes and parts from whence Our Dominions in times of Dearth or Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie haue formerly beene furnished and stored, is such, as little hope of Reliefe is to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or looked for from them: We therefore desiring as much as in Vs lyeth, by Our timely prouidence, to take speedy care for the preuention of the many inconueniences, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise may happen and ensue, haue thought fit by and with the aduice of the Lords and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Our Priuy Councell to declare and publish Our Royall Will, Pleasure and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand therein.</p>

            <p>And for the better Execution of Our will and pleasure herein, Wee doe hereby straitly Charge, will, require and Command, All and singuler Our Customers, Comptrollers, Collectors, Searchers, Wayters, and all other the Officers and Ministers, of all and euery Our Custome-houses and Ports of this Our Kingdome, that they and euery of them doe not vpon payne of Our high Indignation and displeasure, and losse of their Places and Offices, permit or suffer any Corne or Graine to be Shipped, to be Exported, or Transported, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, but shall and will forthwith seize the same as forfeited to Vs.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Arthur Rutter</hi> hath by Counterfeiting of diuers Licences, as Wee are informed, beene the cause of the vndue Transporting of much Corne; Wee doe hereby strictly Charge and Command, all and singuler Our Officers and Subiects whatsoeuer, to vse all care &amp; diligence for the finding of the said <hi>Rutter,</hi> and being found to apprehend him, and carry him before the next Iustice of the Peace, whom Wee doe hereby will &amp; require to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to the Gaole of that County where he shall be apprehended, and thereof speedily to certifie Vs or Our Priuy Councell, To the end he may be proceeded against according to his demerits.
